        Project #4 Description
        <br><br>

        For this project, I didn't have a specific visual look I was going for with any preset. Instead I was trying more to create a series of presets that would look far out and colorful! 
        <br><br>
        
        For preset #1, I chose to go with a mint blue color and straight lines to portray more of a "frozen electric shock" sort of look. I think I suceeded in this and I managed to acheive the look I was going for by increasing the search distance and minimizing the pixel distance. I think it turned out pretty interesting. 
        <br><br>
        
        For Preset #2, I chose a bright green color that gives the design a very chemical/organic look. This design is in my opinion the least interesting of the lot, simply because it isn't varied that much despite having many modifiers applied to its different values. 
        <br><br>

        Preset #3 consists of a small pixel scale, a modified 'PI_4' value, and a small search value. Accompanied by an orange/brown color, I find it comes together to create an almost organic leather looking design.
        <br><br>

        Preset #4 is my favorite of them all, simply because I always find that red on black is a fun and interesting color contrast. this preset shares a number of values from preset #1. The major difference is that it has a much larger pixel scale and a slightly shorter search distance when compared with the search distance of the first preset.
