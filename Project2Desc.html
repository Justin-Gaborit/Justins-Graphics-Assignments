        Project #2 Description
        <br><br>
        
        For this project, my main goals were to understand how to combine html, JavaScript, WebGl, and GLSL. I set out to create a website that could host a camera feed while also overlaying a cellular noise shader. One of the major challenges I faced (while it was also an interesting problem to solve) was figuring out how to gain access to a uniform float inside the fragment shader script so that I could allow the user to modify values such as the noise scale and the tiling effect built into the shader. In conclusion, I made use of “gl.getUniformLocation” in order to locate and modify the values of the shader uniforms that I wanted to allow the user to play around with. One the shader uniform was located and given a JavaScript var to be compared/set to, I created a series of JavaScript keyboard inputs. These inputs use simple “if” statements and “keydown” functions to detect if the user is pressing a key down. The script will then increase or decrease a shader uniform value depending on the key pressed by the user. In order to accomplish this project, I made use of the WebGL template and combined it with a customized version of the cellular noise shader found in “The Book of Shaders”.

        My original aesthetic goal was to create a camera feed that appeared to have static interference disrupting it. I think the best I was actually able to achieve with my skill set was more of a faded orange self printing camera image look. I wish I could have made more of a static noise looking shader, but I think this still turned out interesting enough. Part of me also thinks it looks like a silvertoned music video shader, similar to those seen in the 90’s.

        The project didn’t exactly meet my expectations, but I will say I learned a whole lot of WebGL and JavaScript. Both are languages / API’s I have never touched before until this project but I had a really good time challenging myself to find ways to meet the project's requirements. My favorite part was learning about the different methods of referencing and modifying uniforms from a shader script. I wasn’t able to get tweakpane to work although I would have liked to be able to but I was sadly running out of time so I instead had to opt for keyboard inputs to change values. Not quite as flashy as tweakpane but I still learned some new stuff about JavaScript.
